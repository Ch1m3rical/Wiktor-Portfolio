Place your portrait image here as 'portrait.jpg'.

Optional curated project previews go inside the 'project-images' 
folder as JPGs following the GitHub repo name (e.g., project-images/my-repo.jpg). 
Any repo without a matching file automatically falls back to the generated GitHub Open Graph preview.
